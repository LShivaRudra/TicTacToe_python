# INTRODUCTION
This is a tic-tac-toe game which is made using Python programming language. The main concepts that are used to make this game are : OOPs, functions and dictionaries.

# Structure
There are two files in this project: 
## main.py 
- This file is made mainly for taking user inputs and to make a 2d list in which each list stands for a row in the game board, keep updating this 2d list and checking conditions and sending this 2d list to x_o_design file.
## x_o_design.py
- The use of this is to print the entries in the required pattern after each entry is given by the user.


> For detailed explaination of each file purpose and logic, check out the top part of each file along with the stepwise comments.

# The Game
- After running the **main.py** file, the players will be prompted to provide their names (Player 1 and 2).
-  Player 1 will be prompted to enter the symbol (X or O). 
-  Player 2 will be automatically allotted the other symbol.
-  Now, each player will be asked to enter the position on the tic-tac-toe board where they wanna place their symbols in turns. 
-  This goes on till either of the players win or till its a draw.
