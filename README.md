There are two files in this project:
1)main.py
2)x_o_design.py

1)main.py:
    This file is made mainly for taking user inputs and to make a 2d list in which each list stands for a row in the game board, keep updating this 2d list and checking conditions and sending this 2d list to x_o_design file.

2)x_o_design.py:
    The use of this is to print the entries in the required pattern after each entry is given by the user.

For detailed explaination of each file purpose and logic, check out the top part of each file along with the stepwise comments.

NOTE:I've formatted the code in all the files in this project by myselves in VSCode because on using formatting tool, I was getting syntax errors.
     Also if u're using VSCode, give the name and symbol used by the user in-''. But give the keys for the dictionary elements as integers which 
     will be instructed in the respective file.
